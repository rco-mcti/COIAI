  # For new Projects (beta/V2), a classic PAT or App token might be needed if GITHUB_TOKEN has scope limitations.
  # But assuming usage within same org context often works. 
  # If "Project V2" (memex), GITHUB_TOKEN might not be enough for "write". 
  # User mentioned "rco-mcti/1" which looks like a V2 project number or a classic project ID.
  # We will try with GITHUB_TOKEN first.
